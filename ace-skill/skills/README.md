# ACE Skill Library

Generated skills will be stored in this directory. Each skill entry should include:

- A concise summary of the reusable capability
- Detailed instructions or code snippets
- Metadata about applicability, dependencies, and version history

The curation loop updates this directory as new skills are approved.
